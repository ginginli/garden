# Garden Horizons - Complete Guide

> Garden Horizons is the ultimate Roblox farming experience featuring 5-minute shop cycles, dynamic weather systems, crop mutations, and real botanical learning through the Flora Diary. This comprehensive fan site provides live stock tracking, active redemption codes, hidden secrets, and detailed game mechanics guides to help players maximize their farming efficiency.

Garden Horizons launched with 200,000+ players on day one and continues to grow as one of Roblox's most popular farming games. Our fan site serves the community by providing real-time shop inventory updates, working codes updated daily, secret location guides, and comprehensive gameplay strategies.

## Complete Game Overview

### What is Garden Horizons?
Garden Horizons is a Roblox farming experience where players start with a plot of dirt and a handful of seeds. The game features a unique ripeness system where crops continue to ripen beyond harvest-ready, reaching 'Lush' status for 3x selling value. Unlike traditional farming games, Garden Horizons combines fast-paced economy (5-minute shop cycles), dynamic weather effects, crop mutations, and real botanical education.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. Purchase seeds from Bill's Seed Shop (restocks every 5 minutes)
2. Plant seeds in your plot and water them with Watering Can
3. Watch crops progress through ripeness stages: ripe → very ripe → lush (3x value)
4. Harvest at optimal ripeness based on weather conditions
5. Sell crops and reinvest in better seeds and gear
6. Unlock Flora Diary entries with real botanical facts
7. Compete on global leaderboards and complete quests

## Live Stock Tracking System

### How Stock Works
Both Bill's Seed Shop and Molly's Gear Shop restock simultaneously every 5 minutes on the dot. Stock is limited and shared across all servers - rare seeds like Tomato (x3 quantity) and Banana sell out within seconds. Our live stock tracker pulls data directly from the official Garden Horizons Discord server, displaying updates within seconds of each restock cycle.

## Dynamic Weather System

### Weather Types & Effects

- Standard crop values
- Most common weather condition

- Effect: +25% growth speed
- Mutation: FLOODED variants (1.8x value multiplier)

**Snow**
- Effect: -25% growth speed (slower)
- Mutation: CHILLED/FROZEN variants

- Strategy: Wait it out or plant long-growth crops

### Weather Strategy Tips
- Check weather before planting expensive seeds
- Storm weather = best time for rare seed planting

- Weather changes every 15-30 minutes
- Mutations only occur during specific weather
- FLOODED mutations are most profitable (1.8x)

## Crop Ripeness System

### Ripeness Stages
1. **Planted**: Seed just placed in ground
2. **Sprouting**: First growth stage visible
3. **Growing**: Mid-growth stage
4. **Ripe**: Ready to harvest (1x value)
5. **Very Ripe**: Continued ripening (2x value)
6. **Lush**: Peak ripeness (3x value) - MAXIMUM PROFIT

### Harvest Strategy
- Early Harvest (Ripe): Quick cash flow, lower profit
- Medium Harvest (Very Ripe): Balanced approach
- Late Harvest (Lush): Maximum profit, requires patience
- Weather Consideration: Storm = harvest early for next planting
- Mutation Chance: Longer growth = higher mutation chance

### Growth Times (Approximate)

## Hidden Secrets & Easter Eggs

**Difficulty**: Medium
**How to Access**:
1. Navigate to Plot 3
2. Walk to the left side of the plot
3. Find the cave with blocked entrance
4. Use /e dance2 emote near the corner
5. Enable shift lock and glitch through the wall

**Mystery**: This cave previously contained a secret rose that has been removed in recent updates. The rose's purpose and why it was removed remains unknown. Some players theorize it was a hint for future content that was changed during development.

### 3. IGMA Trans-Receiver Device ⭐ FEATURED
**Location**: Top of hill behind Seed Shop (Plot 3 entrance area)
**Difficulty**: Hard to Find
**How to Access**:
1. Go to spawn area
2. Head behind the Seed Shop and Cell Shop
3. Find the Plot 3 entrance
4. Climb the hill to the very top
5. You'll find the IGMA device displaying morse code

**Community Theories**:

- **Brain Rot Invasion**: Special event with Brain Rot enemies
- **Traveling Merchant**: Convoy system bringing potion merchant
- **Potion Shop**: New NPC selling garden boosts and potions

**Evidence Supporting Potion Theory**:
- Morse code says "convoy inbound"
- Secret lab has spilled potion flask
- Admin mentioned "spilling drink in cave"
- IGMA device = incoming convoy signal receiver

### 4. Hidden Laboratory ⭐ FEATURED
**Location**: Behind Cell Shop, near Plot 1 path

- Barrel with glowing liquid flask on top (green/yellow glow)
- Mysterious question mark symbols on wall (interactive?)
- Hidden magnifying glass in corner (very hard to see)
- Additional rooms behind walls (not accessible yet)

**Popular Theory**: This laboratory is hinting at a future potion shop or garden boost system. The morse code "convoy inbound" combined with the spilled potion suggests a traveling potion merchant will arrive in future updates, similar to the traveling merchant in Grow a Garden.

### 5. Secret Relaxation Spot

**Difficulty**: Medium

1. Go to where the IGMA device is located
2. Walk directly behind the Cell Shop

- Possibly more locations undiscovered

**Theories**:
- Some players think they're keys, not magnifying glasses
- Could unlock future content or secret areas
- Might be related to investigation/quest system
- Could just be decorative easter eggs for atmosphere

**Description**: These transparent objects are extremely difficult to spot. They appear to be magnifying glasses but some players argue they look more like keys due to their shape. Their purpose remains completely unknown.

### 7. Hidden Discord Code

**Status**: No morse code or special markings found
**Help Needed**: If you find this room, share the location!

## Secret Hunting Tips

### Essential Techniques
1. **Use Shift Lock**: Enable shift lock to look around corners and through walls. Essential for finding hidden entrances and glitching into secret areas.

2. **Try Emotes**: Use /e dance2 and other emotes near walls and corners. Some secret areas require emote glitching to access. The dance2 emote is most commonly used for wall clipping.

3. **Explore Hills**: The hill behind the Seed Shop has multiple secrets including the IGMA device, secret bench, and hidden magnifying glass. Climb to the very top and explore every corner thoroughly.

4. **Check Walls**: Some walls can be walked through! Try walking into suspicious-looking walls, especially near shops and plot entrances. The secret lab entrance is a perfect example.

5. **Look for Visual Glitches**: Transparent objects, unusual textures, or slight gaps in terrain often indicate secret locations.

6. **Join Community**: Discord server members share new discoveries daily. Many secrets were found through community collaboration.
